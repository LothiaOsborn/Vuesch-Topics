I'm assuming that no one knows code so I'm not going to do basic HTML here. All discussion points require a name and date as a header. If you reference an email or meeting you need to put the time and date of what you're referencing and preferably with a quote. Let's remember that we are all friends and team members and keep the discussions polite and fair.
